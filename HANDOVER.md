## What Was Done This Session (2026-06-17)

**Deployed to production 2026-06-17** — Ch5 (commit `9ce1964`) and Ch6 text+illustrations, all verified live (HTTP 200).

### Chapter 6 (Dhyana Yoga) authored + illustrated — NEW, complete
- **All 47 verses written** (Madhubani) by 6 parallel agents against a shared outline spec (`docs/chapter-06-outline.md`). Speaker map: 33,34,37,38,39 = arjuna, rest = krishna. Status flipped `coming_soon` → `active`.
- **Sanskrit audited clean** by two independent read-only agents: 0 critical, 0 high across all 47 verses (canonical Devanagari + IAST char-for-char). 2 low-priority dhatu etymology fixes applied (6.22 `yam`→`yad`, 6.23 viyoga notation).
- **All 47 Madhubani illustrations generated** via `node scripts/generate-illustration.mjs --chapter 6 --batch 1-47` — zero failures. Spot-checked v19 (windless-lamp simile), v34 (Arjuna's restless-wind mind), v47 (devoted yogi) — correct Madhubani style and consistent character designs. Same JPEG-data-as-.png caveat.
- Build passes (335 pages); all 47 verse pages reference and ship their images.

### Chapter 5 illustrations generated (Kalamkari)
- Generated all 29 Chapter 5 (Karma Sannyasa Yoga) illustrations via `node scripts/generate-illustration.mjs --chapter 5 --batch 1-29`. Verse 12 hit a transient 503 mid-batch and was regenerated individually. All 29 verified present (1376×768, JPEG-data-as-.png — the known print-pipeline caveat).
- Spot-checked v1/v12/v29 visually: correct Kalamkari style (dense floral borders, flat profile figures, 6-color palette, consistent Krishna/Arjuna character designs).
- Build passes (287 pages); all 29 Ch5 verse pages reference and ship their images.
- Chapter 5 is now fully complete (text + illustrations). **All 7 active chapters are now fully illustrated.**

## What Was Done This Session (2026-06-14)

**Deployed to production 2026-06-14** (commit `b888381`) → https://gita-for-kids.vercel.app — Ch4 index/verses, Ch5 verses, and Ch4 illustrations all verified live (HTTP 200).

### Chapter 4 authored + Chapter 5 authored + Word-by-Word UI redesign + Ch1 translation fixes
- **Chapter 5 (Karma Sannyasa Yoga), all 29 verses written** (Kalamkari) by 4 parallel agents; verse 1 = arjuna, 2–29 = krishna. Status `active`. **TODO: generate 29 Kalamkari illustrations.**
- **Chapter 4 illustrations generated** — all 42 Warli images via the fixed `generate-illustration.mjs` (note: still JPEG-data-as-.png, the known print-pipeline caveat).
- **Chapter 4 (Jnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga), all 42 verses written** by 6 parallel agents against a shared authoring spec (Sanskrit, IAST transliteration, fully-glossed dhatu breakdown, child-friendly meaning, 300–500 word story, reflection). Status flipped `coming_soon` → `active`. Full build passes (257 pages). **TODO: generate 42 Warli illustrations** via `node scripts/generate-illustration.mjs --chapter 4 --batch 1-42`.
- **Word-by-Word (DhatuBreakdown) UI redesigned** — was a collapsed `<details>` accordion, now an always-visible card grid (`src/components/DhatuBreakdown.astro`). Each root renders as a chip with its English gloss split out from the root. Visible by default, no click required.
- **Chapter 1 translation audit (read-only agent) → 4 fixes applied:**
  - v47 `meaning`: removed false "I will not fight" quote (that line is BG 2.9; it contradicted the verse's own `tasthau` = "he remained" gloss)
  - v13 `transliteration`: `paṇavānakagomukhaḥ` → `paṇavānakagomukhāḥ` (plural long-ā, matches Devanagari)
  - v24 dhatu: `īśa (conqueror)` → `īśa (lord, master)` (morpheme is "lord"; "conqueror of sleep" kept as whole-word meaning)
  - v2 dhatu: added missing words `राजा` (the king) and `तदा` (then)
  - Audit also flagged low-severity systemic items NOT yet actioned: unglossed `च` conjunctions across several verses; Devanagari `word` citation/pausa forms differing from inflected sandhi in the `sanskrit` line (editorial convention — needs a decision).

## What Was Done This Session (2026-04-04)

### Comprehensive Publication Readiness QA + Fixes (4 commits)

Ran 5 parallel quality audit agents, then systematically addressed all 38 findings.

#### Commit 1 — Accessibility, Navigation, Mobile UX (23 files)
- `lang="sa"` on all Devanagari text (12+ files)
- ChapterNav filters to active chapters (no 404s)
- Top + bottom verse navigation
- End-of-chapter CTA ("Continue to Chapter X")
- Mobile hamburger menu
- Tooltip tap-to-toggle for touch devices
- Skip-to-content link
- FolkArtBorder on verse meaning section
- Glossary Sanskrit field displayed
- Ch3 v1/v35 transliteration fixes
- `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS
- Scroll-reveal delay capped at 1s
- 9 new glossary terms + maya

#### Commit 2 — Alt Text, Ch1 v4, Bhagavan (6 files)
- 202 descriptive illustration alt texts (new YAML data file + template integration)
- Ch1 v4 story rewrite (166→407 words, "Counting Shadows")
- Standardized "The Blessed Lord" across all chapters

#### Commit 3 — Advaita Vedanta Alignment + Ch1 Story Variety (14 files)
- Ch15 v7/v17/v18 reframed through non-dual lens (amsha as reflection, Purushottama as Brahman)
- Glossary: atman=Brahman, moksha as realization, new maya entry
- Ch1 vv.28-45: 5 modern stories → mythological (Yayati, Amba, Ashwatthama, Dwaraka, dice game)
- Theological refinements: Ch3 v4 naishkarmya, Ch2 v42 Vedas clarification, Ch2 v50 "skill in action", Ch3 v15 karma→Vedas→Akshara chain, Ch3 v27 purusha/prakriti

#### Commit 4 — Ch2 Story Diversity + Remaining Polish (33 files)
- 15 Nandu/Baa stories replaced with diverse characters and sources:
  - Mythological: Prahlada, Nachiketa, Yayati, Shvetaketu (Tat tvam asi), Jadabharata
  - Modern: swimmer in Odisha, tabla student in Varanasi, chess in Chennai, dance in Thanjavur, boatman on Ganga
  - Settings: Bishnoi village, Maiti movement, Khurja pottery, Vipassana Igatpuri, Kochi spice market
- WCAG AA color contrast (text-gray-400 eliminated from cream backgrounds)
- Krishna's sternness restored in Ch2 v2-3
- 3 reflection questions made standalone
- Ch3 v7 Satyajit flagged as imagined
- Ch2 v22 dhatu breakdown expanded (7→13 words)

### Philosophical Orientation
All content follows **Advaita Vedanta** (Shankaracharya's non-dualism). Atman is Brahman; liberation through jnana; maya as the power of appearance; Krishna speaks as Brahman itself.

## Remaining Items

### Resolved This Session
- ~~4 Ch1 illustrations not Madhubani~~ → Regenerated v1, v2, v8, v9 ✓
- ~~Pichwai too similar to Madhubani~~ → All 20 Ch12 images regenerated with dark backgrounds ✓
- ~~Front matter pages~~ → Characters + Pronunciation guide created ✓

### Still Pending (for print publication)
1. **All images are JPEG data saved as .png** (~320 now) — browsers handle it, print pipelines will not. Need format conversion or true PNG regeneration.
2. **Images web-resolution only** (1376×768) — print requires 2816×1536 minimum. Requires higher-res regeneration (Gemini API may not support this natively).

## Next Steps

### Chapter Order
1. ~~Chapter 4 — Jnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga (Warli)~~ — text + illustrations done ✓
2. ~~Chapter 5 — Karma Sannyasa Yoga (Kalamkari)~~ — text + illustrations done ✓
3. ~~Chapter 6 — Dhyana Yoga (Madhubani)~~ — text + illustrations done ✓
4. Next text chapter: **Chapter 7 — Jnana Vijnana Yoga** (Pichwai, 30 verses) — `status: coming_soon`, needs an outline (`docs/chapter-07-outline.md`), then verses authored and illustrated. Follow the Ch6 process: write spec → 6 parallel authoring agents → Sanskrit audit agents → generate illustrations.

### Front & Back Matter
1. ~~Characters page + Pronunciation guide~~ — done ✓
2. Print layout CSS (`@page` rules) — basic rules added, needs testing with actual print
